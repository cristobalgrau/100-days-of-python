# Day 44: Web Foundation - Intermediate CSS

## Project: Motivational Meme Poster Website

The Motivational Meme Poster Website project aims to create a visually appealing webpage that displays a motivational meme. It uses HTML to structure the content and CSS to style the elements, providing a practical introduction to web development.

### Key Features:

- **Motivational Meme Display**: Showcases an image with a motivational quote.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the webpage looks good on different devices with the viewport meta tag.
- **Custom Font Integration**: Uses Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the text.

### Implementation:

1. **HTML Structure**

The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the basic structure of the webpage. Key elements include:

- **Head Section**: Contains metadata, links to the CSS file, and integrates Google Fonts for custom typography.
- **Body Section**: Contains a div element with a class of zone, which includes an image and text elements to display the meme.

2. **CSS Styling**

The CSS file (`style.css`) is used to style the HTML elements. Key styling rules include:

- **Background Color**: Sets the background color of the entire page to black for contrast.
- **Container Styling**: Centers the zone container on the page and sets its width and margins.
- **Image Styling**: Adds a white border to the image and ensures it scales to fit the container width.
- **Text Styling**: Customizes the appearance of the heading and paragraph text using the Libre Baskerville font, white color, and uppercase transformation for the heading.

### Learning Objectives:

- **HTML Elements**: Practice using basic HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), and images (`<img>`).
- **CSS Styling**: Learn to use CSS for styling text, images, and the overall layout, including the use of classes and IDs.
- **Custom Fonts**: Understand how to integrate and use custom fonts from Google Fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: Learn to use the viewport meta tag to ensure the webpage is responsive and displays well on various devices.
