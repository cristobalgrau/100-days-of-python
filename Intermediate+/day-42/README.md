# Day 42 - Web Foundation - Intermediate HTML

## Project: House of the Dragon Basic HTML web page

This HTML project titled "House of the Dragon TV Series" is designed to help beginners practice and understand fundamental HTML elements. The webpage showcases basic HTML elements and attributes through the theme of the popular TV series "House of the Dragon." Hereâ€™s an overview of the HTML elements used in this project:

### Explanation of HTML Elements:

1. **Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`):**
  - `<h1>`: Represents the main heading of the webpage, indicating the primary topic.
  - `<h2>`: Subheading that provides additional context such as the release date.
  - `<h3>`: Smaller subheadings used to introduce specific sections of content.

2. **Image (`<img>`):**

- The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in the webpage. It includes attributes such as src (source URL of the image), width, and height to define the size of the image.

3. **Unordered List (`<ul>`):**

- The `<ul>` tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list. Each item in the list is enclosed within `<li>` (list item) tags.

4. **Anchor (`<a>`):**

- The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.


### Learning Objectives:

- **Using Headings**: Understanding how to structure content with different levels of headings to organize information hierarchically.
- **Embedding Images**: Learning how to use the <img> tag to add images to a webpage and manage their size with attributes like width and height.
- **Creating Lists**: Practicing the creation of unordered lists with the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags to display related items.
- **Adding Hyperlinks**: Using the `<a>` tag to create clickable links that navigate to other webpages or resources.
