# Day 43 - Web Foundation - Introduction to CSS

## Project: Colour Vocabulary Website

The Colour Vocabulary Website project is designed to help users learn the names of colors in Spanish. It includes an HTML file to display the content and a CSS file to style the page. This project focuses on basic HTML and CSS skills, including the use of images, text styling, and color properties.

### Key Features:

- **Color Vocabulary**: Displays the names of colors in Spanish alongside images.
- **Styling with CSS**: Uses CSS to style the text and images on the page.

### Implementation:

1. **HTML Structure**

The HTML file (`index.html`) sets up the basic structure of the webpage. Key elements include:

- **Head Section**: Includes metadata and links to the CSS file for styling.
- **Body Section**: Contains headings and images representing different colors. Each color is presented with a Spanish name and a corresponding image.

2. **CSS Styling**

The CSS file (`style.css`) is used to style the HTML elements. Key styling rules include:

- **Color Styling**: Uses CSS IDs to assign specific colors to the text of each color name.
- **Image Styling**: Sets the height and width of the images to ensure uniformity.
- **Text Styling**: Applies a normal font-weight to the color titles for a consistent appearance.

### Learning Objectives:

- **HTML Elements**: Practice using basic HTML elements such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), images (`<img>`), and links.
- **CSS Styling**: Learn to use CSS for styling text and images, including the use of IDs and classes.
- **Attributes**: Understand the use of attributes like src for images and id for styling specific elements.
