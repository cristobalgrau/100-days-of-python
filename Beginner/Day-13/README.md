# Day 13 - Debugging: How to Find and Fix Errors in your Code

In this crucial stage of the bootcamp journey, you'll hone your skills in detecting and resolving bugsâ€”those pesky errors 
that can derail even the most carefully crafted code. Through a series of hands-on exercises and strategic problem-solving techniques.

### Key Learning Objectives

- **Describe the Problem:** Define what is doing every block of code to understand what should do it vs what it's doing
- **Reproduce the Bug:** systematically reproduces bugs, pinpointing the precise conditions under which errors occur. 
- **Think Like a Computer:** Channel your inner computer as you step through code execution line by line. By meticulously tracing the flow of program execution and evaluating variable states, you'll uncover hidden discrepancies and uncover the root causes of errors.
- **Utilize print() Statements:** Harness the power of print statements to illuminate the inner workings of your code. By strategically placing print statements at critical junctures, you'll gain visibility into variable values, function outputs, and program flow, facilitating rapid diagnosis and resolution of bugs.
- **Embrace Debugger Tools:** Explore the capabilities of debugger applications, powerful tools that provide real-time insights into code execution. With features such as breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-by-step execution, debuggers offer a comprehensive toolkit for efficient bug hunting.
