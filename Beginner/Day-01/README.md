# Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Project: Band Name Generator

This Python project serves as a fun and creative exercise in generating unique band names. 
Inspired by the fusion of personal elements, the Band Name Generator prompts users to input their birth city or a preferred city and 
the name of their pet. Leveraging these inputs, the program combines them to produce a distinctive band name.
