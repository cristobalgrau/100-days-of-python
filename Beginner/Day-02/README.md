# Day 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

## Project: Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator project is designed to streamline the process of splitting bills and calculating tips. 
Upon inputting the total bill amount, users are prompted to specify their desired tip percentage from predetermined options (10%, 12%, or 15%).
Additionally, the program inquires about the number of individuals splitting the bill. 
Leveraging this information, the Tip Calculator swiftly computes the total amount to be paid by each person, inclusive of the tip.
