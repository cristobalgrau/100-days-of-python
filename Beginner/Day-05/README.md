## Project: Password Generator

This program empowers users to create strong and unique passwords tailored to their preferences. 
Upon execution, users are prompted to specify the composition of their password, including the desired number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
With options ranging from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, to special symbols, users can customize their password strength 
based on their security needs.
