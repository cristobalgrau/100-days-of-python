# Day 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction

## Project: Secret Auction

This program simulates a covert auction process, enabling participants to submit confidential bids and determine the highest bidder 
without revealing competing offers. With its emphasis on data encapsulation and algorithmic logic, this project offers valuable insights 
into auction mechanisms and data manipulation techniques.

The program's user interface offers a seamless bidding experience, prompting participants to input their name and bid amount discreetly.
Upon completion of bidding, the program reveals the winner with the highest bid, maintaining the secrecy of competing offers.
