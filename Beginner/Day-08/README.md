# Day 8 - Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

## Project: Caesar Cipher

Delve into the realm of cryptography with the Caesar Cipher Python project! This implementation of the classical substitution 
cipher demonstrates key concepts in encryption and decryption techniques, offering an interactive platform for exploring security algorithms.

The Caesar Cipher operates by shifting each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. This shift value, 
also known as the key or shift amount, determines the encryption or decryption process. In this project, 
the alphabet is represented as a list of lowercase letters, enabling seamless manipulation and traversal.

Upon execution, users are prompted to specify the desired operation—either encoding or decoding—along with the plaintext message 
and shift amount. The program then applies the Caesar Cipher algorithm to generate the encrypted or decrypted text, providing users 
with the transformed message.
