# Day 4 - Randomisation and Python Lists

## Project: Rock Paper Scissors Game

This program simulates the classic hand game where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors to determine the winner. 
Upon execution, users are prompted to select their choice—Rock, Paper, or Scissors—by entering the corresponding number. 
The computer randomly selects its choice as well, creating an exciting matchup.

The outcome is determined by the traditional rules of the game: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
