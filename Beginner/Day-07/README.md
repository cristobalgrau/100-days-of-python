# Day 7 - Hangman

## Project: Hangman Game

Experience the classic word-guessing challenge with the Hangman Game Python project!

This interactive console-based application challenges players to guess a hidden word letter by letter, 
showcasing fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data structures.

Upon execution, the program initializes by randomly selecting a word from a predefined list. 
The length of the chosen word determines the number of underscores displayed, representing hidden letters.

Players interact with the game by inputting their guesses for individual letters. 
Each guess undergoes validation to ensure it meets the game's rules. If a guessed letter is correct, 
the corresponding underscores are replaced with the correct letter, revealing its position within the word.
To enhance user experience, the program displays a graphical representation of the hangman's gallows as incorrect guesses accumulate. 

The game continues until either the player successfully guesses all letters in the word or exhausts their allotted number of lives. 
Upon game completion, a victory or defeat message is displayed based on the outcome.
