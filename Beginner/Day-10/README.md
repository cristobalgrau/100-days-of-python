# Day 10 - Functions with Outputs

## Project: Calculator

This versatile program empowers users to perform basic mathematical calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
through an intuitive command-line interface. Featuring modular design and dynamic function mapping, the Calculator project offers a 
comprehensive toolkit for numerical computation and problem-solving.

The project leverages Python's functional programming capabilities to define individual operations as standalone functions, 
promoting code modularity and reusability. Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
is encapsulated within a dedicated function, enabling seamless integration and extensibility.

The heart of the Calculator project lies in its operation mapping dictionary, which associates mathematical symbols with corresponding 
calculation functions. This dynamic mapping mechanism facilitates streamlined operation selection and execution, enhancing user 
experience and code efficiency.
