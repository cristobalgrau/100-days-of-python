## Project: Treasure Island

Inspired by classic choose-your-own-adventure tales, this program transports players to a mysterious island in search of hidden treasure.
In this program the players encounter pivotal decisions at crossroads, determining their fate. 
Navigate through perilous scenarios, including choosing between pathways, crossing treacherous lakes, and exploring eerie houses 
with colored doors. Each choice made shapes the outcome, leading to either triumphant discovery or unfortunate defeat.
