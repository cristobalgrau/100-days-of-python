# Day 12 - Scope & Number Guessing Game

## Project: Number Guessing Game

This interactive program challenges players to predict a random number within a specified range, testing their intuition, 
logic, and deductive skills. 

### Gameplay Mechanics

The project follows a simple yet engaging gameplay loop, where players attempt to guess a randomly selected number within a 
predefined range (1 to 100). 

Key gameplay mechanics include:

- **User Interaction:** Players interact with the game through a command-line interface, inputting their guesses and receiving feedback on their progress.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Players can choose between two difficulty levels—easy and hard—each offering a different number of attempts to guess the correct number.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** After each guess, players receive feedback indicating whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

### Core Functions
The project is powered by essential functions that handle key game logic and user interaction:

- `compare_numbers()`: Compares the player's guessed number with the randomly selected number, providing feedback on the accuracy of the guess.
- `set_difficulty()`: Allows players to choose the difficulty level, determining the number of attempts available for guessing the correct number.
- `play_guessing_game()`: Drives the main gameplay loop, orchestrating the sequence of actions from game initialization to conclusion.

### Dynamic Gameplay
The Number Guessing Game offers dynamic gameplay that adapts to player actions and choices. Players experience the thrill of 
anticipation as they narrow down the possible range of numbers and strive to make educated guesses to uncover the hidden number.
